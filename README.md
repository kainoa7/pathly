## 🧪 Mock vs Real Implementation

### **Why Mock First?**
After extensive OAuth troubleshooting (documented in [`OAUTH_JOURNEY.md`](./docs/OAUTH_JOURNEY.md)), we strategically chose mock implementation for:

- **🚀 Rapid Prototyping** - Test UX without complex OAuth setup
- **💰 Cost Management** - Avoid API costs during development
- **🎯 Feature Validation** - Prove concepts before real integration
- **📊 Stakeholder Demos** - Consistent demonstration experience

### **Mock Implementation Benefits**
- ✅ All features immediately testable
- ✅ Realistic career scenarios for proper UX validation
- ✅ No external dependencies or API quotas
- ✅ Consistent development environment

### **Future Real Implementation**
Clear migration path documented for:
- Gmail OAuth integration (lessons learned from troubleshooting)
- OpenAI API for real AI analysis
- ElevenLabs for voice synthesis
- Calendar APIs (Google, Outlook, Apple)
