First-Run Onboarding Implementation Summary
==========================================

✅ COMPLETED: First-Run Onboarding Modal with Profile Data Collection

🔧 FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:

BACKEND:
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma (added onboarding fields to User model)
- backend/src/api/auth/routes.ts (added POST /api/auth/profile endpoint, updated GET /api/auth/me)
- backend/src/middleware/auth.ts (updated user selection to include onboarding fields)

FRONTEND:
- frontend/src/state/user.ts (NEW - Zustand store for user state management)
- frontend/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingModal.tsx (NEW - 3-step onboarding modal)
- frontend/src/App.tsx (integrated user state and onboarding modal)

🗄️ DATABASE CHANGES:
- Added onboarding fields to User model:
  - major String? (user's major/field of study)
  - interests String @default("[]") (JSON array of interests, stored as string for SQLite)
  - goals String? (career goals, max 1000 chars)
  - onboardingComplete Boolean @default(false) (tracks completion status)
- Migration: 20250808045630_add_onboarding_fields

📦 NEW DEPENDENCIES:
- zustand (frontend state management)

🛡️ SECURITY & VALIDATION:

Backend Validation:
✅ major: String, max 200 characters
✅ interests: Array, max 8 items, each max 100 characters
✅ goals: String, max 1000 characters  
✅ graduationYear: Number, 1900-2050 range
✅ onboardingComplete: Boolean
✅ JWT authentication required for all profile operations

Frontend Validation:
✅ Major required and length validation
✅ At least 1 interest required, max 8 allowed
✅ Goals required and length validation
✅ Graduation year selection from dropdown
✅ Real-time character counting
✅ Step-by-step validation before proceeding

📡 BACKEND ENDPOINTS:

✅ GET /api/auth/me (requireUser)
   - Returns current user with onboarding fields
   - Parses interests from JSON string to array
   - Includes onboardingComplete flag

✅ POST /api/auth/profile (requireUser)
   - Updates user profile information
   - Body: { major?, interests?, goals?, graduationYear?, onboardingComplete? }
   - Validates all fields with detailed error messages
   - Stores interests as JSON string in database
   - Returns updated user object with parsed interests array

🎨 FRONTEND COMPONENTS:

✅ User State Store (Zustand):
   - User data management with loading/error states
   - fetchUser() - retrieves current user from /api/auth/me
   - updateProfile() - updates profile via /api/auth/profile
   - Automatic token handling and error management

✅ OnboardingModal Component:
   - 3-step MUI Stepper interface:
     Step 1: Basics (major, graduation year)
     Step 2: Interests (multi-select chips)
     Step 3: Goals (multiline text input)
   - Real-time validation with error display
   - Cannot be closed until completed
   - Responsive design with Material-UI components
   - Loading states and error handling

✅ App Integration:
   - Automatic user state initialization on app load
   - Conditional modal display for incomplete onboarding
   - Modal shows only for authenticated users with onboardingComplete=false
   - Automatic re-fetch after onboarding completion

🔄 USER FLOW:

1. **New User Journey**:
   - User signs up/logs in → onboardingComplete=false
   - App loads → fetchUser() detects incomplete onboarding
   - OnboardingModal automatically appears
   - User completes 3-step process
   - Profile saved with onboardingComplete=true
   - Modal disappears and doesn't reappear

2. **Existing User Journey**:
   - User with onboardingComplete=true logs in
   - App loads → fetchUser() detects completed onboarding
   - Modal does not appear
   - Normal app experience continues

🧪 VALIDATION & ERROR HANDLING:

Backend Validation Errors (400):
```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "message": "Invalid profile data", 
  "details": [
    "Major must be a string with max 200 characters",
    "Interests must be an array with max 8 items",
    "Graduation year must be a number between 1900 and 2050"
  ]
}
```

Frontend Validation:
- Real-time field validation with error display
- Step-by-step validation prevents progression with invalid data
- Character counters for text fields
- Interest selection limits with visual feedback
- Network error handling with user-friendly messages

📋 INTEREST OPTIONS:
- AI & Machine Learning
- Software Engineering  
- Product Management
- Cybersecurity
- Data Science
- UI/UX Design
- DevOps
- Mobile Development

🔧 TECHNICAL DETAILS:

Database Storage:
- interests stored as JSON string in SQLite (["AI", "Software Engineering"])
- Parsed to/from array in API responses for frontend compatibility
- graduationYear stored as string for consistency with existing field

State Management:
- Zustand store provides reactive user state across app
- Automatic token validation and user re-fetching
- Error states and loading indicators
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety

Modal Behavior:
- Blocks app interaction until completed (disableEscapeKeyDown)
- Stepper navigation with validation gates
- Success feedback and automatic closure
- Graceful error handling and recovery

🧪 ACCEPTANCE TESTS - ALL PASSED:

✅ Backend Endpoints:
- GET /api/auth/me without auth → 401 "Access token required"
- POST /api/auth/profile without auth → 401 "Access token required"
- Profile validation working correctly
- Interests stored/retrieved as JSON properly

✅ Frontend Integration:
- User state automatically loads on app boot
- Modal appears for users with onboardingComplete=false
- Modal hidden for users with onboardingComplete=true
- Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- Profile updates trigger state refresh

✅ End-to-End Flow:
- New user signup → modal appears → submit → modal disappears
- Existing user login → modal does not appear
- Profile data persisted correctly in database
- User experience smooth and intuitive

🎯 UX HIGHLIGHTS:

1. **Progressive Disclosure**: 3-step process breaks down information collection
2. **Visual Feedback**: Stepper shows progress, validation errors clearly displayed
3. **Smart Defaults**: Current year graduation, common interest options
4. **Accessibility**: MUI components provide built-in accessibility features
5. **Responsive Design**: Works across desktop and mobile devices
6. **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages and retry mechanisms

🚀 FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS:

1. **Analytics**: Track onboarding completion rates and drop-off points
2. **Personalization**: Use profile data for content customization
3. **Profile Editing**: Allow users to update profile later via settings
4. **Advanced Interests**: Add more granular interest categories
5. **Goal Tracking**: Progress tracking toward stated career goals
6. **Recommendations**: Use profile data for personalized content/features

This implementation provides a comprehensive first-run onboarding experience that:
- Collects essential user profile data for personalization
- Provides excellent UX with step-by-step guidance
- Maintains security with proper authentication and validation
- Integrates seamlessly with existing authentication system
- Sets foundation for personalized user experiences throughout the app
