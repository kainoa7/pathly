Stripe Billing Implementation Summary
====================================

✅ COMPLETED: Stripe Subscriptions + Webhook Integration

🔧 FILES CREATED/MODIFIED:
- backend/prisma/schema.prisma (added Subscription model, stripeCustomerId unique constraint)
- backend/src/utils/billing.ts (NEW - Stripe utilities and helpers)
- backend/src/api/billing/routes.ts (NEW - billing routes with auth protection)
- backend/src/app.ts (added raw body parser for webhooks, registered billing routes)

📋 NEW DEPENDENCIES:
- stripe (Stripe SDK for Node.js)

🗄️ DATABASE CHANGES:
- Added Subscription model with stripeSubscriptionId, plan, status tracking
- Added unique constraint on User.stripeCustomerId
- Migration: 20250808043040_add_stripe_billing

⚙️ ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (add to .env):
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_..."
- STRIPE_PRICE_PRO="price_..." 
- STRIPE_PRICE_PREMIUM="price_..."
- STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET="whsec_..."
- FRONTEND_BASE_URL="http://localhost:5173"
- BILLING_SUCCESS_PATH="/billing/success"
- BILLING_CANCEL_PATH="/billing/cancel"

🛡️ SECURITY FEATURES:
✅ Protected routes with requireUser middleware
✅ Webhook signature verification with STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
✅ Raw body parser for webhooks (signature verification requirement)
✅ NO authentication on webhook endpoint (Stripe signature provides security)
✅ Minimal error messages; detailed logging for debugging
✅ Idempotent webhook processing with upsert operations

💳 BILLING ROUTES:
✅ POST /api/billing/create-checkout-session (requireUser)
   - Body: { plan: "pro" | "premium" }
   - Creates Stripe customer if needed, updates User.stripeCustomerId
   - Returns { url, sessionId } for frontend redirect
   - Graceful fallback when Stripe not configured (503 response)

✅ POST /api/billing/create-portal-session (requireUser)
   - Requires existing stripeCustomerId
   - Returns { url } for customer billing portal
   - Graceful fallback when Stripe not configured (503 response)

✅ POST /api/billing/webhook (NO AUTH - Stripe signature verification)
   - Raw body parser for signature verification
   - Handles: checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated/deleted, invoice.payment_failed
   - Automatic account upgrades/downgrades based on subscription status
   - Comprehensive error handling and logging

🔄 WEBHOOK EVENT HANDLING:
✅ checkout.session.completed:
   - Creates/updates Subscription record
   - Maps price ID to plan ("pro" | "premium")
   - Upgrades User.accountType (EXPLORER → PRO/PREMIUM)
   - Sets stripeCustomerId on user

✅ customer.subscription.updated:
   - Updates Subscription.status
   - Downgrades to EXPLORER if status is canceled/unpaid/past_due

✅ customer.subscription.deleted:
   - Marks subscription as canceled
   - Downgrades user to EXPLORER

✅ invoice.payment_failed:
   - Logs payment failure for monitoring
   - No immediate downgrade (Stripe handles retries)

🛠️ HELPER FUNCTIONS:
✅ priceIdToPlan(priceId): maps Stripe price IDs to "pro" | "premium"
✅ planToAccountType(plan): maps plans to AccountType.PRO | AccountType.PREMIUM
✅ planToPriceId(plan): maps plans to Stripe price IDs
✅ verifyWebhookSignature(): validates Stripe webhook signatures
✅ createStripeCustomer(): creates customer with userId metadata
✅ createCheckoutSession(): subscription checkout with success/cancel URLs
✅ createPortalSession(): billing portal for subscription management

🧪 ACCEPTANCE TESTS - ALL PASSED:
✅ Login as EXPLORER → call create-checkout-session(pro) returns URL
✅ Protected routes require authentication (401 without token)
✅ Graceful degradation when Stripe not configured (503 responses)
✅ Webhook endpoint accessible without auth but requires signature
✅ Portal session creation follows proper auth flow

🚀 PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST:
✅ Set all STRIPE_* environment variables
✅ Configure Stripe webhook endpoint: POST /api/billing/webhook
✅ Set webhook events: checkout.session.completed, customer.subscription.updated, customer.subscription.deleted, invoice.payment_failed
✅ Test with Stripe test mode before going live
✅ Monitor webhook logs for processing errors
✅ Set up proper error alerting for payment failures

💼 FRONTEND INTEGRATION:
Frontend should:
1. Call POST /api/billing/create-checkout-session with { plan: "pro" | "premium" }
2. Redirect user to returned URL for Stripe Checkout
3. Handle success/cancel redirects configured in environment variables
4. After successful payment, refetch GET /api/auth/me to see updated accountType
5. Use POST /api/billing/create-portal-session for subscription management

🔐 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:
- Webhook signatures prevent malicious requests
- User metadata in Stripe links subscriptions to internal user IDs
- Idempotent webhook processing prevents duplicate account changes
- Stripe customer IDs stored securely and used for portal access control
- All billing routes protected except webhook (which has signature verification)

📊 SUBSCRIPTION STATUS MAPPING:
- Stripe "active" | "trialing" → User remains PRO/PREMIUM
- Stripe "canceled" | "unpaid" | "past_due" → User downgraded to EXPLORER
- Database tracks both Stripe subscription status and local account type

This implementation provides secure, scalable subscription billing integrated with the existing JWT authentication system, maintaining all prior JWT functionality while adding comprehensive Stripe payment processing.
