- `invalid_client` errors due to client ID typos
- Redirect URI mismatches
- Consent screen configuration complexity
- Test user management

**Solutions Applied**:
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive OAuth documentation
- ‚úÖ Mock implementation as fallback
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step troubleshooting guide
- ‚úÖ Direct connection bypass for development

**Lessons Learned**:
- Always plan extra time for OAuth setup
- Mock implementations are valuable for OAuth-heavy features
- Document exact OAuth configuration steps
- Provide fallback modes for development

### 2. JSX Syntax Issues

**Challenge**: React JSX parser interpreting `<5` as HTML tag start.

**Problem**: 
```jsx
// This breaks JSX parsing:
<div>Reduce to 1 page for roles with <5 years experience</div>
```

**Solution**:
```jsx
// Escape the less-than symbol:
<div>Reduce to 1 page for roles with {'<'}5 years experience</div>
```

**Lessons Learned**:
- Always escape special characters in JSX content
- Use linting rules to catch these issues early
- Test with realistic content that includes special characters

### 3. Content Security Policy (CSP) Issues

**Challenge**: Inline JavaScript in OAuth callback popup blocked by browser CSP.

**Problem**: 
```
Refused to execute inline script because it violates CSP directive: "script-src 'self'"
```

**Solutions**:
- ‚úÖ Added CSP headers: `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`
- ‚úÖ Implemented direct mock connection bypass
- ‚úÖ Multiple fallback strategies

**Lessons Learned**:
- Plan for CSP restrictions in production
- Always have fallback authentication flows
- Test popups and inline scripts in realistic environments

### 4. Animation Performance

**Challenge**: Maintaining 60fps animations with complex UI.

**Strategies**:
- ‚úÖ Use CSS transforms for animations (GPU acceleration)
- ‚úÖ Minimize re-renders with React.memo and useMemo
- ‚úÖ Stagger animations to reduce simultaneous work
- ‚úÖ Use Framer Motion's optimized animation system

**Outcome**: Consistent 60fps performance across all sections.

## üìä Performance Decisions

### Bundle Size Optimization

**Current Metrics**:
- **Frontend Bundle**: ~2MB (including animations)
- **Load Time**: <2 seconds local development
- **Memory Usage**: ~50MB backend process

**Optimization Strategies Implemented**:
- ‚úÖ Tailwind CSS purging for smaller stylesheets
- ‚úÖ Efficient React patterns (minimal re-renders)
- ‚úÖ Framer Motion tree-shaking

**Future Optimizations**:
- [ ] Code splitting for section components
- [ ] Lazy loading for heavy features
- [ ] Image optimization for company logos
- [ ] Service worker for caching

### State Management Decisions

**Current Approach**: useState hooks in single component

**Rationale**:
- Simple for prototype phase
- No external dependencies
- Easy to understand and debug

**Future Migration Path**:
- Zustand for lightweight state management
- React Query for API state
- Local storage for user preferences

## üîÑ Mock Data Strategy

### Mock Email Implementation

**File**: `backend/src/data/mockEmails.ts`

**Design Principles**:
- **Realistic Content**: Based on actual career scenarios
- **Variety**: Different email types (offers, rejections, interviews)
- **Progressive Complexity**: Range from simple to complex scenarios
- **Career-Focused**: All content relevant to professional development

**Mock Scenarios**:
1. **High-Priority Offer** (Meta) - Tests negotiation features
2. **Interview Follow-up** (Netflix) - Tests scheduling integration
3. **Networking Opportunity** (OpenAI) - Tests relationship management
4. **Engineering Discussion** (Tesla) - Tests technical conversation
5. **Polite Rejection** (Google) - Tests disappointment handling

**Lessons Learned**:
- Mock data should mirror real data structure exactly
- Include edge cases and varied content
- Make scenarios personally relevant for better testing
- Document mock scenarios for future real implementation testing

### Mock API Endpoints

**Strategy**: Mirror real API structure with mock responses

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Mock Gmail routes maintain same interface as real Gmail API
router.get('/init', mockGmailInit);
router.get('/callback', mockGmailCallback);
router.get('/emails', mockGmailEmails);
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Easy migration to real APIs
- ‚úÖ Frontend code remains unchanged
- ‚úÖ Realistic error handling testing
- ‚úÖ Performance testing with realistic data

## üéØ UX/UI Design Decisions

### Color Palette Choice

**Primary**: Cyan/Blue (#00f5ff, #0891b2)
**Secondary**: Purple/Pink (#8b5cf6, #ec4899)
**Neutral**: Gray scale with transparency

**Rationale**:
- **Professional**: Blue conveys trust and professionalism
- **Futuristic**: Cyan accents suggest advanced technology
- **Accessibility**: High contrast ratios for readability
- **Brand Differentiation**: Unique in career assistant space

### Animation Philosophy

**Approach**: Subtle, purposeful animations that enhance usability

**Principles**:
- **Performance First**: 60fps or no animation
- **Meaningful Motion**: Every animation serves a purpose
- **Consistent Timing**: Standard easing curves and durations
- **Accessibility**: Respect user motion preferences

**Implementation**:
- Entry animations: 300-500ms with easeOut
- Hover effects: 150-200ms with easeInOut
- Loading states: Continuous, subtle movements
- Transitions: Smooth, directional movement between states

### Information Hierarchy

**Strategy**: Progressive disclosure with clear visual hierarchy

**Implementation**:
- **Headers**: Large, bold typography with icons
- **Content Cards**: Grouped related information
- **Action Items**: Prominent buttons with clear labeling
- **Status Indicators**: Color-coded with explanatory text

## üîê Security Considerations

### Mock Mode Security

**Current State**: Safe for development
- No real user data processed
- No external API calls with sensitive information
- Local data only

### Future Security Requirements

**Authentication**:
- OAuth 2.0 with proper PKCE implementation
- Secure token storage and rotation
- Session management with appropriate timeouts

**Data Protection**:
- End-to-end encryption for email content
- Secure API key management
- GDPR compliance for EU users
- Data retention policies

**API Security**:
- Rate limiting for all endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- CORS configuration for production
- CSP headers for XSS protection

## üìà Scalability Decisions

### Current Architecture Limitations

**Single Component**: Will need refactoring for team development
**In-Memory State**: Won't scale beyond single user session
**Mock Data**: Hard-coded, not database-driven
**No Caching**: Every request regenerates mock data

### Planned Scalability Improvements

**Component Architecture**:
- Feature-based component splitting
- Shared state management system
- Reusable component library

**Data Management**:
- Database-driven mock data
